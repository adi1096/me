TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#General Notes taken during my first attempt at this task. As python was a new concept to me back then, I have detailed how to commit and push items through.

Once all activities are complete, commit with a message and then push it through.
When running things from the terminal window, input python3.7 before starting the codes.
Ensure that when running the Debug Console, that the file is actively open (not the readme file).
Also enusure that launch is replaced with python (if the first setting does not work).
To Debug, press the play button.
Return is exclusive to functions and is much more powerful (only works in a function)
you can use the outputs from other functions when writing new functions.

#Exercise 1




#Exercise 2 
This required the amendment of two items.
- The first item is the brackets used to denote list. When denoting a list, it needs to be done using a () round bracket.
- When referencing an index, the [] square brackets need to be used. This is the case with alphabet[]
- The print statement needs to be placed before the return statement
- _name_ == '_main_' - This format is essential inorder for the code to work.


#Exercise 3

This was the most difficult exercise. Refer to the lessons learnt during this exercise.








Additional Notes:
for loop 6 its 
total lenght of list = 10 - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
i = 0
if i <= total lenght of list
return i(range)
i = i + 1
else exit function
