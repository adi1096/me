TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Once all activities are complete, commit with a message and then push it through.
When running things from the terminal window, input python3.7 before starting the codes.
Ensure that when running the Debug Console, that the file is actively open (not the readme file).
Also enusure that launch is replaced with python (if the first setting does not work).
To Debug, press the play button.
Return is exclusive to functions and is much more powerful (only works in a function)
you can use the outputs from other functions when writing new functions.

if i <= total lenght of list

return i(range)
